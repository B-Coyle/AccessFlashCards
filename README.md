This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##  Project Description
For this project, I wanted to create an application that solves a common problem that most students face when reviewing course material/concepts - finding effective study techniques to optimize learning retention and recall. I decided to focus my attention on the subject of Accessibility and ARIA - which can sometimes get neglected in the grand scheme of things. I wanted to raise awareness of ARIA/Accessibility because everyone deserves to view applications and use programs no matter what.
